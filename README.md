# Ohno-board

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
Ohno-board was made as one of the fastest projects I felt it was of the entire class list. If you are wondering about the name I based it on the creator of the Kanban Board, which was a japanese developer for the Toyota company. I wanted to make something that resembles the usage of the Kanban style and purpose. It solves many styling opportunities for the UI, it uses cards, columns, and continuous improvements to the page. I learned that it can be hard to get the UI to work properly and that sometimes the path can get tricky to figure out.
